# Signal Processing

This repository contains the projects developed while studying signal processing at ECN, all code has been developed using MATLAB.

The first labâ€™s main aim is to master the concept of Fast Fourier Transform and implement it on a Matlab script.
The second part focuses instead on the processing of an audio file and its coding and decoding.
In the third lab, we concentrate on the system aspect of the course. The aim is to analyze a concrete example as the control of a space shuttle during an aero-assisted orbit
transfer.
